# Car Dealership Project

We discussed the possibility of having a `.txt` file in the same directory as all these files that could possible contain information about past sales,
or if not that maybe it could contain information about cars that are currently on the lot.  We could then create a driver file that reads in the information
from that file and keeps track of the cars that are on the lot (Maybe that means that we need a Dealership Class, that contains a list of Car objects as a variable),
Just some ideas.  

Here is a link to a .pdf file of the textbook *C++: How to Program* if you guys would like to have some reference for the c++ language.

Please see the Projects page for more info, and maybe post any other ideas there in the same or a different project.
